# This streamlit app is for downloading Bioproject and biosample metadata from NCBI. I also added functionality to download Geo Series(GSE) data from GEO.

# The Geo part is a little buggy, but will still download the data.

# The first thing you will need is an api key from NCBI to use the Entrez API. This is needed for downloading data from PMID/BioProject. GSE data can be downloaded without the key.

# You can get the API key from https://support.nlm.nih.gov/knowledgebase/article/KA-05317/en-us
